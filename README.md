# Astrolander

> Astrolander is a 3D space navigation game inspired by classics such as Lunar Lander, Gravity Force, and Uchuusen. Developed using the GameStart3D engine by [Emmanuel Julien](https://github.com/ejulien/) and programmed in [Squirrel](https://github.com/albertodemichelis/squirrel), I crafted this game between 2011 and 2012 and documented the process extensively on the [TigSource.com](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=20609.0) forums, a community hub for indie game developers.<br>

### Game Overview

In Astrolander, players control a spacecraft through 25 levels of increasing difficulty, navigating obstacles and collecting items to progress. I designed the game with a simplified two-button control system to optimize the experience on tablets and smartphones, providing intuitive gameplay suitable for both casual and seasoned gamers.

### Development Highlights

- **Community Engagement:** I regularly updated and discussed the project on TigSource forums, using community feedback to refine gameplay balance and mechanics.
- **Innovative Controls:** Based on physics, I developed a unique control mechanic that prevents the spacecraft from flipping over, reducing frustration and enhancing the realistic navigation feel.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** I optimized Astrolander for both Windows and Android platforms to ensure smooth and responsive experiences across different devices.

### Contributions and Innovations

- **Comprehensive Design:** Except for the music and some 2D illustrations, I handled all aspects of the project, from game design and 3D graphics to coding, including shaders.
- **Community-Driven Development:** Feedback from TigSource was crucial in refining the game controls and physics, ensuring enjoyable and immersive gameplay.

Astrolander stands as a testament to the power of community collaboration in game development and the ongoing appeal of physics-based navigation games.
